      <h2>Highlights:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Communication with Parents</h3>
          <p>Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, observations, and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h3>
          <p>The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Discipline</h3>
          <p>Emphasizing safety and positive behavior, the staff is trained to anticipate and address potential issues promptly, with a focus on encouraging self-management and skill development. The discipline policy relies on positive reinforcement, social interaction anticipation, re-direction, validating feelings, and expressing disappointment respectfully, aiming to make school a positive and rewarding experience. In cases of persistent inappropriate behavior, collaboration with parents is sought, and if necessary, recommendations for alternative preschool programs or community services are provided to ensure each child's growth and a suitable learning environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Preschool Philosophy</h3>
          <p>The philosophy of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our approach is “hands-on,” where children act upon what they are learning and feeling. We consider the process more important than the product. Teachers provide the opportunity for children to interact with their environment in ways that are meaningful to them.</p>
