        <li><h3>Communication with Parents</h3></li>
          <p>
            Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
            give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
            emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
            concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
            or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.	
          </p>
        <li><h3>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h3></li>
            <p>
              The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
              informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
              more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
              time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers. 
            </p>
        <li><h3>Discipline</h3></li>
          <p>
          Emphasizing safety and positive behavior, the staff is 
          trained to anticipate and address potential issues promptly, with a focus on
          encouraging self-management and skill development. The discipline policy relies
          on positive reinforcement, social interaction anticipation, re-direction, 
          validating feelings, and expressing disappointment respectfully, aiming to
          make school a positive and rewarding experience. In cases of persistent 
          inappropriate behavior, collaboration with parents is sought, and if 
          necessary, recommendations for alternative preschool programs or 
          community services are provided to ensure each child's growth and 
          a suitable learning environment.</p>
        <li><h3>Preschool Philosophy</h3></li>
          <p>
            The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
            approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
            consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
            children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them.
          </p>
